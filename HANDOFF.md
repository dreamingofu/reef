# Reef — handoff notes (resume on another machine)

Last updated: 2026-10-21.

## What's running

| Piece | Where | Port | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Navidrome v0.64.2 | Android phone, Termux (`~/navidrome`, data in `~/nd`) | 4533 | Music folder `~/storage/shared/Music`, scan every 1 min, admin user `marianne` |
| Reef (this repo) | Android phone, Termux (`~/reef`) | 5274 | Flask app: YouTube search, play, **+** keeps `.opus` into `Music/Reef/`, then triggers a Navidrome rescan |
| Amperfy | iPhone | — | Subsonic server `http://100.78.71.110:4533` |
| Reef web UI | iPhone Safari / Home Screen app | — | `http://100.78.71.110:5274` |

- Phone: ARM64, Android 16, Termux + Termux:Boot from F-Droid. Tailscale IP `100.78.71.110`.
- Autostart: `~/.termux/boot/` has a Navidrome script and `reef.sh` (copied from `termux/reef-boot.sh`). A reboot test passed: both came back on their own.
- Already done over ADB: phantom process killer disabled; Termux and Termux:Boot exempt from battery optimization.
- Reef config on the phone: `~/reef/reef.env` (it holds the Navidrome password and is git-ignored).
- Transcoding: Navidrome's built-in "opus audio" profile works. It overshoots the requested bitrate by ~25%, so set Amperfy's cellular bitrate to 96–112 to get a real ~128 kbps.

## Updating the phone after changing code

1. Commit and push to `main`.
2. In Termux on the phone, run `cd ~/reef && git pull --ff-only && ~/.termux/boot/reef.sh`
   (or re-run `termux/install.sh`, which also pulls and restarts).

### Driving the phone from a Mac (no typing on the phone)

```bash
brew install android-platform-tools      # adb
adb devices                              # USB, or: Developer options > Wireless debugging > adb pair / adb connect
```

`adb shell` can't enter Termux's environment (`run-as` fails because F-Droid Termux isn't debuggable). Instead, bring Termux to
the front and type into it. Send the output to shared storage so you can read it back:

```bash
adb shell am start -n com.termux/.app.TermuxActivity
adb shell "input text 'cd ~/reef; git pull --ff-only > /sdcard/navidrome_setup/update.log 2>&1; ~/.termux/boot/reef.sh'"
adb shell input keyevent 66              # Enter
adb shell cat /sdcard/navidrome_setup/update.log
```

To reach the phone's services from the Mac: `adb forward tcp:5274 tcp:5274` (Reef) and `adb forward tcp:4533 tcp:4533` (Navidrome).
Then open `http://127.0.0.1:5274/api/health`. Or skip adb and use the Tailscale IP if the Mac is on the tailnet.

## Local development

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt          # also needs ffmpeg for downloads: brew install ffmpeg
REEF_PORT=5300 REEF_MUSIC_DIR=/tmp/reef-music \
REEF_NAVIDROME_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4533 REEF_NAVIDROME_USER=marianne REEF_NAVIDROME_PASS=... \
python app.py
```

Pass the Navidrome password through the environment. Don't put it in a committed file: this repo is public.

## Code map

- `app.py`: routes (`/api/search`, `/api/stream/<id>` with Range passthrough, `/api/download`, `/api/jobs`, `/api/history`,
  `/api/library/recent`, `/api/cover/<id>`, `/api/health`).
- `search.py`: yt-dlp flat search. `streamer.py`: resolves bestaudio (m4a preferred for iOS) and proxies it.
- `downloader.py`: in-memory job queue + worker (yt-dlp → Opus, tags, cover, blank description) → `history.add` → Navidrome rescan.
- `history.py`: `history.json` list of kept tracks (git-ignored). `navidrome.py`: Subsonic token auth, ping, startScan, newest albums, cover art.
- `templates/index.html` + `static/style.css` + `static/app.js`: the mobile UI, vanilla JS, no build step.

## UI (Octave-style redesign, 2026-10-21)

The layout is modelled on music.octavestreaming.com's mobile app, built from scratch with no copied assets. It has a black background,
pink accent `#fb2c5a`, frosted-glass floating nav pill (Home / Kept / Downloads) with a round search button, and a glass
mini-player that opens a full-screen Now Playing sheet (blurred artwork background, swipe down to close). Home shows a greeting, a
For you / Library toggle, a "Jump back in" poster shelf, Recently kept, Recent searches, and genre tiles. Search shows a Top
result card, Songs rows with **+**, and filter chips. Design tokens are at the top of `static/style.css`.

## Ideas / next steps

- Check the redesign on the iPhone (Safari and the Home Screen app): safe-area spacing, glass blur performance.
- Play kept and Navidrome tracks from Navidrome's own stream instead of YouTube (add a `/api/nd-stream/<id>` proxy).
- Save the playback queue across reloads; add a lyrics view.
- Optional `REEF_PASSWORD` in `reef.env` if Reef ever gets exposed beyond the tailnet.
